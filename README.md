# Experimentation with Compiler Design (G--)

This was one of my super early projects, but it taught me a ton. It was originally named g++, but once I learned what the real g++ was, I changed the name. This is why the source code references it as g++ or .gpp files. The first thing it did was it got me into low level design and inspired all my more impressive projects like the [Custom CPU](), [Custom CPU V2](), [Chip8 Emulator](), [NES Emulator](), [HTML renderer]() and my [Custom OS](). In addition to getting me into low-level programming, this project also taught me a bit about unit testing and GitHub. Both of these are things that I tend to neglect, as most of my projects are written mainly for me, but they definitely gave me the skills that I plan to use in the workforce.

# Overview

## JavaScript Parser

This is the most advanced proejct and is stored in the root directory with the unit test in the /Tests folder. I started it by watching an old tutorial where only the first few episodes were free. After digging around and finding a list of the episode names I used those to figure out what to do next. Meaning almost all the code was written from scratch. While I hated dealing with the missing episodes at the time, looking back it made the project much more impressive and taught me way more than watching videos would have.
