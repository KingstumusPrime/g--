# Experimentation with Compiler Design (G--)

This was one of my super early projects, but it taught me a ton. It was originally named g++, but once I learned what the real g++ was, I changed the name. This is why the source code references it as g++ or .gpp files. The first thing it did was it got me into low-level design and inspired all my more impressive projects, like the [Custom CPU](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/Custom-CPU-V1/tree/main), [Chip8 Emulator](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/Chip8-Emulator/tree/master), [NES Emulator](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/Nes-Emulator/tree/master), and [HTML renderer](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/htmlParserAndRenderer/tree/master). In addition to getting me into low-level programming, this project also taught me a bit about unit testing and GitHub. Both of these are things that I tend to neglect, as most of my projects are written mainly for me, but they definitely gave me the skills that I plan to use in the workforce.

# Overview

## JavaScript Parser

This is the most advanced project and is stored in the root directory with the unit test in the /Tests folder. I started it by watching an old tutorial where only the first few episodes were free. After digging around and finding a list of the episode names, I used those to figure out what to do next. Meaning almost all the code was written from scratch. While I hated dealing with the missing episodes at the time, looking back it made the project much more impressive and taught me way more than watching videos would have.

## Python Lexer

This was another little project I made. I cannot remember the exact time I made it, but I am pretty sure it was the first thing I made. It's not very impressive, but it does read the code from a file, which was pretty cool to me at the time.

## C++ VM

After making the lexer, I decided I wanted my language to run off of a VM similar to Java, so I decided to write the VM in C++ found in /vm. At the time I was mixing way too many languages, which is probably why I stopped working on the project, but this VM is pretty fun of a project. At the time I only knew of stack-based machines, so it has zero registers. This was my first big exposure to assembly language that I fully understood.

## Java VM

This one is found in /vm/vm and is definitely the least impressive project here. I found a clip of a college lecture and followed it without understanding anything about Java, assembly, or the stack (in a stack-based machine). While it's unimpressive, it inspired me to write my [own version in C++](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/g--/tree/root?tab=readme-ov-file#c-vm) from scratch. In addition, it was my first exposure to assembly, not the first one I understood but the first.
